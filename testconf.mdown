`testconf.py` is a file containg additional data needed for tests such as
usernames and passowrds for servers (for pushing tests)

Here is shown example `testconf.py` file:


    # if it's local server it will provide you with
    # the ability to test while offline
    # if you want to skip tests that require server
    # leave this variable blank
    SERVER_ENABLED_TESTS = True
    test_server_url = 'http://127.0.0.1/pakenode'
    test_server_host = '127.0.0.1'
    test_server_cwd = 'pakenode'
    test_server_username = 'username123'
    test_server_password = 'password123'

    # Test network
    test_network_url = 'http://127.0.0.1'   # without trailing slash
    test_network_host = '127.0.0.1'         # host of your test network
    test_network_wd = 'paketest'
    test_network_user = 'marekjm'
    test_network_pass = 'pass'
