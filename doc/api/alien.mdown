### Alien API structure

Here are shown paths that can be used to access various information on an alien or
(mirror if you are interaction with alien originating from your node).
`:foo`-like strings describe variable endpoints.


    ROOT = http://pake.example.com

    # obligatory part of the API (net expanding alien a.k.a. NEA)
    /meta.json
    /mirrors.json
    /alines.json
    /packages.json

    # API exposed by aliens which provide downloadable packages
    /packages/:name/versions.json
    /packages/:name/versions/:version/meta.json
    /packages/:name/versions/:version/dependencies.json
    /packages/:name/versions/:version/build.tar.xz
    /packages/:name/versions/:version/signature.asc [**not implemented**]

    # optional part of the API (caching is done as a last-hope mechanism when trying to obtain
    # a package whose alien of origin is no longer available and all its mirror are down)
    /cached.json
    /cached/{name}-{version}.tar.xz
    /cached/{name}-{version}.asc


Files from `ROOT/packages/:name/:version:/build.tar.xz` are saved as `{:name}-{:version}.tar.xz` files in
`~/.pakenode/cached/` directory.
